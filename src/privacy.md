# Privacy

Let’s be honest, this page is completely unwarranted on a site so spartan. I just wanted the excuse to have a bunch of text to typeset.

The gist is that you use this website, and anything hosted here, at your own risk. That includes anything you download from here to your own device. However, I’m not going to intentionally host or share anything here that would compromise your device or be otherwise unsavoury. I do my best not to be an asshole.

I take privacy seriously. This website has no analytics. None. In its current state, I don’t even know how many people visit this site per month. I have no way to know you’re reading this. I may add some analytics at some point, but judiciously and respectfully. I’ll update this page if I do that.
