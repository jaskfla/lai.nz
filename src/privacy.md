Let’s be honest, this page is <em>completely</em> unnecessary on a site so spartan. I just wanted more text to typeset.

The gist is that you use this site—and anything hosted here—at your own risk. That includes anything you download from here to your own device. However, I’m not going to intentionally host or share anything here that would compromise your device or be otherwise unsavoury. I do my best not to be an asshole.

I like my privacy too, so this site has no analytics. None. I don’t know how many visitors come by, and I’ll never know you’re reading this (unless you reach out!). If I ever add analytics, I’ll update this page, and include an easy way to opt out.

I do use webfonts, but they’re all served from this domain. There is no third party. Hopefully at some point I’ll get around to letting you use only system fonts anyway.
