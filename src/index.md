I’m a final year software engineering student at [Waipapa Taumata Rau](https://www.auckland.ac.nz 'University of Auckland'), and a full-stack developer intern at [Beyond Essential Systems](https://bes.au).

I’m also an alumnus of [<abbr title="Auckland University of Technology">AUT</abbr>](https://www.aut.ac.nz), where I specialised in <abbr title="user experience">UX</abbr>/<abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr> design, and minored in sound design.

This is a playground of sorts, where I let myself mess with technologies and ideas I don’t otherwise get to play with.
