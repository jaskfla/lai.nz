I make stuff with web tech—currently healthcare software at

Systems</a>.

I’m a recent software engineering graduate from
<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz" title="University of Auckland" rel="external" target="_blank">Waipapa
Taumata Rau</a>; also an alumnus of
<a href="https://www.aut.ac.nz" rel="external" target="_blank">
<abbr title="Auckland University of Technology">AUT</abbr></a>, where I
specialised in
<abbr title="user experience">UX</abbr>/<abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr>
design, and minored in sound design.
