I make this website mostly in service of my own itches, but would nevertheless
like it to be usable by anyone who comes by, regardless of technology or
ability.

The code driving this site is standards-compliant
<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org" rel="external" target="blank"><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr></a>,
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS" rel="external" target="blank"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></a>
and JavaScript; and is made with the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22" rel="external" target="_blank">Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines&nbsp;2.2</a> in mind. (I’m also pinching a few
improvements from the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag3" rel="external" target="_blank"><abbr>WCAG&nbsp;3</abbr>
drafts</a>.) Text should be readable, images should have descriptions, and
everything should be keyboard-navigable.

This site is and will always be a work in progress. If there’s any part of it
that you find difficult to use, please let me know in a
<a href="{{ metadata.repoUrl }}/issues" rel="external" target="_blank">GitHub
issue</a>, or by
<a href="&#109;&#97;&#73;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;{{ metadata.email }}">emailing
me</a> directly. I’ll try to fix it as soon as time allows.

Though I can’t guarantee accessibility of stuff I link to, I try to select and
promote work by people who also value
<a href="https://inclusivedesignprinciples.info" rel="external" target="_blank">inclusive
design</a>.
