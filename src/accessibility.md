I make this website mostly in service of my own itches, but would nevertheless like it to be usable by anyone who comes by, regardless of technology or ability.

The code driving this site is standards-compliant [<abbr>HTML</abbr>](https://html.spec.whatwg.org), [<abbr>CSS</abbr>](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS) and JavaScript; and is made with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22) in mind. (I’m also pinching a few improvements from the [<abbr>WCAG 3</abbr> drafts](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag3).) Text should be readable, images should have descriptions, and everything should be keyboard-navigable.

This site is and will always be a work in progress. If there’s any part of it that you find difficult to use, please let me know in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/jaskfla/lai.nz/issues), or by <a href="&#109;&#97;&#73;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;{{ metadata.email }}">emailing me</a> directly. I’ll try to fix it as soon as time allows.

Though I can’t guarantee accessibility of stuff I link to, I try to select and promote work by people who also value inclusive design.
