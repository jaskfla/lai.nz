_Kia ora, Jasper here._ I do stuff with the web. I’m not currently open for new
work; but here’s a li’l something about how I approach my work and
<a href="https://bes.au" rel="external" target="_blank">my workplace</a>.

## A bit about me

My jobby-job calls me a full-stack web developer. Really, I’m a
<a href="https://maggieappleton.com/design-engineers" rel="external" target="_blank">design
engineer</a>. The
<a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development" rel="external" target="_blank">front-of-the-front-end</a>
sort, for whom design and engineering are different perspectives of the same
thing.

**I love web technologies, and I love the web.** JavaScript
<a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2010/10/every-day-i-learn-something-new-and-stupid/#comment-1020" rel="external" target="_blank">has
a lot of stupid</a> in it, and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
<a href="https://github.com/jensimmons/cssremedy" rel="external" target="_blank">has
some tech debt</a>. But that hasn’t stopped people from making some pretty cool
shit. It also isn’t governed by a single, for-profit company—and that’s pretty
neat.

**I’m attuned to the web’s principles, and work
<a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain" rel="external" target="_blank">with
its grain</a>.** I keep up-to-date with draft, spec and browser updates. I have
annoying opinions about the cascade,
<a href="https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour" rel="external" target="_blank">Locality
of Behaviour</a> and you-name-it. But my interfaces are adaptive, my markup
debuggable, and my work inclusive. I code with semantics, progressive
enhancement and design research.

**Also, I’m a big font nerd.** Real big.

## A bit about you

Your work and your process are design-led, informed by your ethical values.

Your consensus are borne by your alignment, not vice versa.

Your team feel ownership over their work. They are afforded the agency to _do
the thing_ and _do the thing well_.

You value families, but aren’t one.

You see the world through a lens of relationships, not a series of discrete
projects.

Your teams are small. Humans work best at human-scale.

## Proficiencies & idiosyncrasies

<aside style="color: var(--color-fg-2); font-style: italic;">
This is not a
<abbr title="strengths, weaknesses, opportunities & threats">SWOT</abbr>. It is
an articulation of characteristics. Some may present unambiguously as strengths,
others as clear weaknesses; but all can be framed as either. I’ll let you judge.
</aside>

I’ve been described as focused, questioning, and attentive to momentum.

React is my bread-and-butter, though I’m happiest
<a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html#PLP" rel="external" target="_blank">when
I don’t need it</a>.

I have an appetite for resilience, for inclusion, and for better&mdash;none of
which are easily measurable.

I know my way around Figma, am fluent in
<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and
<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and understand the intricacies
of design systems.

I’m an unremarkable ideator but a strong editor.


I am unironically, unashamedly curious.
