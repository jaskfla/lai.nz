The typefaces around here are [Warbler](https://djr.com/warbler) by David Jonathan Ross and [Concourse](https://mbtype.com/fonts/concourse) by Matthew Butterick.

Butterick’s book, [_Practical Typography_](https://practicaltypography.com), taught me most of what I know about typography. You should read it—it’s free.

I use [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) to build this site, and host it with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). Its code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/jaskfla/jaskfla.github.io), if that piques your interest.
