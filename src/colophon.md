The typefaces around here are
<a href="https://djr.com/warbler" rel="external" target="_blank">Warbler</a> by
David Jonathan Ross and
<a href="https://mbtype.com/fonts/concourse" rel="external" target="_blank">Concourse</a>
by Matthew Butterick.

Butterick’s book,
<a href="https://practicaltypography.com" rel="external" target="_blank"><i>Practical
Typography</i></a>, taught me most of what I know about typography. You should
read it&mdash;it’s free.

<i>{{ metadata.domain }}</i> is designed and built by me; and in a real sense
also by the many who inform my sensibilities, and whose work inspire mine.

I use <a href="https://www.11ty.dev" rel="external" target="_blank">Eleventy</a>
to build this site, and host it with
<a href="https://www.netlify.com" rel="external" target="_blank">Netlify</a>.
Its code is [on GitHub]({{ metadata.repoUrl }}), if that piques your interest.
My domain comes via
<a href="https://www.gandi.net" rel="external" target="_blank">Gandi</a>; and
<abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> stuff runs through Cloudflare’s
pipes (though I anticipate switching to
<a href="https://dns.kitchen" rel="external" target="_blank"><abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> Kitchen</a>.
